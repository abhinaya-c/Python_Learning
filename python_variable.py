#Variables:
#varibles are containerd for storing data values.


#Creating Variables:
#Example:

x = 5
y = "WRC"
print(x)
print(y)

#Changing Type after they have beem\n set.
x = 4          #x is of type int 
x = "NesCafe"  #x is now of type str
print(x)


#CASTING AND GET TYPE

x = str(3)   # x will be '3'
y = int(3)   # y will be 3
z = float(3) # z will be 3.0

#Get type

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

#Single or Double Quotes?

x = "James"
# Both are same 
x = 'James'

#Case-Sensitive
#variable names are case-sensitive.

#This will create two variables:
a = 4
A = "Simon"
# A will not overwrite a 
print(a)
print(A)
